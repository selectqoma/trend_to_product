    Review the trend list produced by the Scout. For each trend, assess:
    - Market size and addressable audience
    - Existing competition and differentiation angle
    - Monetisation potential (B2B SaaS, API, marketplace, etc.)
    - Technical feasibility for a 3-person team in 3 months
    Rank ALL trends, then select your TOP 3. A human will make the final choice.

    The chosen idea to design is provided below. Produce a full product design sheet.
    Include: personas (2-3), MVP feature list (max 8), recommended tech stack
    with justification, high-level data model (entities + key fields), REST/GraphQL
    API surface (endpoints or queries), and a 3-phase roadmap (MVP, Growth, Scale).

    CHOSEN IDEA:

builder_task:
  description: >
    Implement the product described in the design sheet below as a runnable starter
    project. Use the "Write Project File" tool to write each file individually —
    one tool call per file. Use "{project_slug}" as the project_slug for every call.

    Write at minimum these files:
    - README.md
    - backend entry point (e.g. backend/src/main.ts or backend/main.py)
    - one API route file
    - one data model / schema file
    - frontend index page
    - .env.example
    - .github/workflows/ci.yml

    Keep each file focused and production-quality but concise. After writing all
    files, output a short summary listing what was created.

    DESIGN SHEET:
    {design_sheet}
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation that all files were written via the Write Project File tool,
    followed by a bullet list of the files created.
