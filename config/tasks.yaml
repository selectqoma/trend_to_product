    Use all available tools to collect trending topics from Hacker News, GitHub
    Trending, Reddit, ProductHunt, and Twitter.
    {topic_hint}
    Synthesise findings into a JSON array of the top 10 trends, sorted by
    estimated momentum. Each entry must include: title, source(s), why_trending,
    and opportunity_hint.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON array with exactly 10 trend objects, each with keys:
    title, sources (list), why_trending (string), opportunity_hint (string).
  output_file: "storage/trend_list.json"

critic_task:
  description: >
    Review the trend list produced by the Scout. For each trend, assess:
    - Market size and addressable audience
    - Existing competition and differentiation angle
    - Monetisation potential (B2B SaaS, API, marketplace, etc.)
    - Technical feasibility for a 3-person team in 3 months
    Select ONE winner. Justify your choice rigorously, then output a JSON object
    with the winning idea.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with keys: trend_title, problem_statement, target_user,
    differentiation, monetisation, feasibility_score (1-10), rejection_reasons
    (object mapping other trend titles to one-line rejection reason).
  output_file: "storage/winning_idea.json"

architect_task:
  description: >
    Using the winning idea from the Critic, produce a full product design sheet.
    Include: personas (2-3), MVP feature list (max 8), recommended tech stack
    with justification, high-level data model (entities + key fields), REST/GraphQL
    API surface (endpoints or queries), and a 3-phase roadmap (MVP, Growth, Scale).
  expected_output: >
    A well-structured Markdown document covering all sections listed above.
    Use headers, bullet points, and code blocks where appropriate.
  output_file: "storage/design_sheet.md"

builder_task:
  description: >
    Implement the product from the Architect's design sheet. Generate a complete
    starter project. Output MUST include a fenced JSON code block (```json ... ```)
    containing a single object that maps relative file paths to their full string
    contents. Cover at minimum: backend entry point, one API route, one model/schema,
    frontend index page, README, and a CI workflow file.
    Keep each file focused and production-ready.
  expected_output: >
    A brief summary paragraph followed by a ```json code block containing the file
    manifest. Keys are relative paths (e.g. "backend/main.py"), values are the
    complete file contents as strings.
